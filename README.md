# Optical-Character-Recognition
To segment handwritten text into individual characters and identify the characters, developed in Matlab.

The project is based on Hu's Moment Invariants which help in detecting characters even when they are rotated by some degree.
The project functionalies include - 
1) Segemtation using bounding box. This is done by first dividing the page of text into seperate lines aand then segementing out individual characters from each line.
2) Training and Recognition is done based on Hu's Movement Invariants.
